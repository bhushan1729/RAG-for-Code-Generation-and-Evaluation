### The text contains test cases, test steps, and corresponding Python codes:  
- The beginning section provides one similar test cases, along with Python code written by humans.  
- At the end, it includes the test steps for a new test case to be automated and the code generated by an LLM for this case.    

### Evaluation Guidelines:  
- **Score** the generated code on a scale of 1 to 10.  
- **Highlight all issues** in the generated code, including missing elements, incorrect logic, or deviations from the provided test steps.  
- **Provide a justification** for your score, focusing on alignment with the test steps and identifying any missing or incorrect parts.
- **Understand the comments between the code and log messages to map steps to the corresponding code blocks**
- **Avoid redundant comments; if the steps are clear, corresponding code block is present and the logic is correct, do not add comments.**  
- Use **Chain of Thought reasoning** to explain your analysis clearly.

### Scoring Guide:  
- **1-3:** Very poor results. The code has major issues or hallucinations and requires significant modifications to run the test case.  
- **4-5:** Unusable code. It is somewhat related to the input steps but misses key objectives. Debugging would take more time than rewriting.  
- **6-7:** Adequate results. The code is usable but needs adjustments, such as fixing incomplete functions or incorrect function calls.  
- **8:** Good results. The code achieves the objective, with only minor issues (e.g., logging errors, variable name mismatches).  
- **9-10:** Very good results. The code aligns well with the steps, achieves the objective, and can be executed without issues.  

Ensure your evaluation includes the score, a detailed explanation, and any recommendations for improvement.
