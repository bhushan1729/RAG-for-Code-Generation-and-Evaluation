### Inputs:
In the 'Similar Test Case' section, you'll find a test case with its steps and code for reference. Below that, there is Python code generated by a model based on the given test steps. This code was reviewed using LLM as a judge, and the feedback, including score, comments and issues, is listed in the 'Comments and Issues' section.

### Task:
Your task is to update and improve the code using the similar test case, provided test steps, and the LLM as a judge's feedback. While making changes, keep the overall structure and correct parts of the original code the same. Only update sections with clear differences or those related to fixing the identified issues. 

**Adheres to PEP 8 coding guidelines and uses snake_case for variable, function, and method names. Use chain of thoughts while generating the outputs.**

### Simlar Test Case 1: Generate a Python script based on the provided testing steps to verify test mention in the summary.
Similar Test Case Python Code 1:
###--Start of python code--
<python code>
###--End of python code--

### Test Case to be Automated:
Code Generated by LLM:
###--Start of python code--
<python code>
###--End of python code--

### Comments and Issues:
###Expected output: The generated code should be fully accurate and optimized to achieve a higher score when reviewed again by the LLM as a judge.<|end|>
